    ### TaskFlow API Tutorial Documentation
    This is a simple data pipeline example which demonstrates the use of
    the TaskFlow API using three simple tasks for Extract, Transform, and Load.
    Documentation that goes along with the Airflow TaskFlow API tutorial is
    located
    [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial_taskflow_api.html)
